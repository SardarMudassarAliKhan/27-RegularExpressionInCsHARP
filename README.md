Regular expressions in C#. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation in C#. Here's a basic example of how you can use regular expressions in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string input = "Hello, this is a test string with 123 numbers.";

        // Define a pattern to match numbers
        string pattern = @"\d+";

        // Create a Regex object with the pattern
        Regex regex = new Regex(pattern);

        // Match the pattern against the input string
        MatchCollection matches = regex.Matches(input);

        // Iterate over the matches and print them
        foreach (Match match in matches)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Found number: " + match.Value);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- We import the `System.Text.RegularExpressions` namespace to use regular expression functionality.
- We define an input string that contains a mixture of text and numbers.
- We define a regular expression pattern `\d+` to match one or more digits.
- We create a `Regex` object with the pattern.
- We use the `Matches` method of the `Regex` object to find all matches of the pattern in the input string.
- We iterate over the `MatchCollection` and print each match found.

You can customize the regular expression pattern according to your specific needs for pattern matching. Regular expressions offer a wide range of features and syntax for complex pattern matching tasks in C#.
